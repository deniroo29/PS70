    Hey there! I'm Teddy Zheng a Freshman ('29) living in Apley Court (it's as nice as the rumors say). 
    It's only the first couple days of school, but as of now I am considering concentrating in CS and possibly double concentrating in either Film or Physics.
    I am from Cleveland, Ohio and I went to a small school called Hawken School. 
    Naturally I am a huge Cleveland sports fan, so if you ever want to talk about the Cavs, and Browns or Guardians (kindly... please) I am your guy.
    I also have a bit of experience making things we may explore in this class from either SciOly or personal interest (see below)
